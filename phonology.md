Plosive		p, b		t, d		k, g		q, Q
Nasal		m				n		N
Fricative	f, v		th, dh		x, X

### Notes
* Plosives: All stops may be pronounced unaspirated, aspirated, and/or/vel as ejectives.
* Nasals: All nasals are voiced, unlike the Plosives and Fricatives which have a voicing distinction.
* t, d: these are dental, not Alveolar or Post-Alveolar. The tongue is positioned as for [θ] or [ð], but articulated as in English /t/ or /d/.
* q, Q: these are as /k/ and /g/, but further back in the throat. Q is the voiced version of q.
* n: this is [ŋ], with the same place of articulation as /k/ or /g/.
* N: this is [ɴ], which is even further back in the throat, at the same place of articulation as q and Q.
* f, v: these are further forward than their English equivalents.
* th, dh: these are just the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives which are in English.
* x, X: this has the same place of articulation as /k/ and /g/.
